## MCU Atmega328P chip 

This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and it can be used separately on a breadboard.

## Joystick 

The analog 2-axis thumb joystick with button by Makerfabs (China). The joystick has two analog(10k potentiometers), you'll need two analog (ADC) reading pins on your microcontroller to determine X and Y.

## L298N Motor Driver

The double H bridge motor drive module (uses ST company's L298N as the main driver chip) by Album (China). The module is featuring strong driving capability, low heat generation and strong anti-interference ability. 

## Joystick Algorithm Simulation

The Youtube simulation demonstrates the joystick algorithm, used to control a simulated two-wheeled differential drive robot.

## Testing Platform

- This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and the price is affordable as well as most of the robotic hardware that is described here. The Arduino Uno board comes with a removable MCU.

- **PlatformIO** is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products. 

- **Visual Studio Code** is a streamlined code editor and it runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The best thing about VSCode, it is free.

## Issues

- None

## In Development

- In the **SJUL** folder is the version based on the older **JUL** without encoders. (**S**implified **J**oystick **U**no **L**298N)

- In the **JULE** folder is the version which has encoder code... (**J**oystick **U**no **L**298N **E**ncoders)

## NOTICE

- The JUL_Debug_Version folder and the JUL_Release_Version folder have been removed since January 02, 2023.
