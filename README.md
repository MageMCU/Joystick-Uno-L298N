## MCU Atmega328P chip 

This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and it can be used separately on a breadboard.

## Joystick 

The analog 2-axis thumb joystick with button by Makerfabs (China). The joystick has two analog(10k potentiometers), you'll need two analog (ADC) reading pins on your microcontroller to determine X and Y.

## L298N Motor Driver

The double H bridge motor drive module (uses ST company's L298N as the main driver chip) by Album (China). The module is featuring strong driving capability, low heat generation and strong anti-interference ability. 

## Joystick Algorithm Simulation

The Youtube simulation demonstrates the joystick algorithm, used to control a simulated two-wheeled differential drive robot.
