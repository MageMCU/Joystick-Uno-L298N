## Simplified-Joystick-Uno-L298N (SJUL) Repository

- namespace ***uno***

The Debug and Release versions have been removed for a simplified version, a compromise if you will. The Joystick Algorithm had to be simplified for upcoming projects. Each of the classes, the Joystick ALgorithm Class, and the L298N Class have been rewritten. The dependencies are the Bitwise Class, the Button Class, the LinearMap Class and the Timer Class.

## MCU Atmega328P chip 

This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and it can be used separately on a breadboard.

## Joystick 

The analog 2-axis thumb joystick with button by Makerfabs (China). The joystick has two analog(10k potentiometers), you'll need two analog (ADC) reading pins on your microcontroller to determine X and Y.

## L298N Motor Driver

The double H bridge motor drive module (uses ST company's L298N as the main driver chip) by Album (China). The module is featuring strong driving capability, low heat generation and strong anti-interference ability. 

## Joystick Algorithm Simulation

The Youtube simulation demonstrates the joystick algorithm, used to control a simulated two-wheeled differential drive robot.

## Testing Platform

- This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and the price is affordable as well as most of the robotic hardware that is described here. The Arduino Uno board comes with a removable MCU.

- **PlatformIO** is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products. 

- **Visual Studio Code** is a streamlined code editor and it runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The best thing about VSCode, it is free.

## Issues

- None

## In Development

The SJUL_Release_Version will be tested periodically as described in the Testing Platform and to the standards set in platformio.ini settings.

- Total Rewrite 20230102 where the **SJUL project** is now under development...

## NOTICE

- The JUL_Debug_Version and the JUL_Release_Version are removed since January 02, 2023.
