## MCU Atmega328P chip 
This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and the chip can be pulled out to be used separately on a breadboard. Best to purchase directly from Arduino online store. Beware of fake Arduino boards...

## Joystick 
The analog 2-axis thumb joystick with button. The joystick has two analog(10k potentiometers), you'll need two analog (ADC) reading pins on your microcontroller to determine X and Y. Can be purchased from Amazon online...

## L298N Motor Driver
The double H bridge motor drive module (uses ST company's L298N as the main driver chip). The module features strong driving capability, low heat generation and strong anti-interference ability. Can be purchased from Amazon online...

## Joystick Algorithm Simulation
The Youtube simulation demonstrates the joystick algorithm, used to control a simulated two-wheeled differential drive robot.

## Testing Platform
- This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and the price is affordable as well as most of the robotic hardware that is described here. The Arduino Uno board comes with a removable MCU.
- **PlatformIO** is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products. 
- **Visual Studio Code** is a streamlined code editor and it runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The best thing about VSCode, it is free.
